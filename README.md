# Infamous-Nighthawk
Infamous Nighthawk is a project that is trying to create a WiFi/Bluetooth penetration testing tool using the LilyGo T-Disaplay S3. 

This project is taking a heavy amount of inspiration from justcallmekoko's [ESP32Marauder](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder) project.
